# ARCHIVED: This project is no longer maintained


This project was started and completed by Russell Waterhouse.  
It was my first nontrivial development project, and I am still proud of what I was able to accomplish while knowing so little.  

However, it is a project where the cost to maintain is too large, and the benefit too small, to justify continued maintenance.  
It wouldn't increase my development skills more than the projects I'm currently working on, and it wouldn't
be a big benefit to the wider public, as many better alternatives that do the same job exist. 

I leave this project here, publicly visible but unmaintained, out of my own sentimentality for the project.

# course_planner: What the project was
This project was an android mobile app that allowed college and university students to plan out what semester they 
wanted to take courses in during their degree. It allowed students to input information about all their courses, 
such as course names, pre-requisites, and offered semesters. Students could then move courses around to create 
semester plans they were happy with.  

I used it for the entire length of my degree while I attended the University of Victoria. 

This project was live on the Google Play Store from 2019 to 2022.

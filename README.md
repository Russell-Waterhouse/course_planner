# ARCHIVED: This project is no longer maintained


This project was started and completed by Russell Waterhouse.  
It was my first nontrivial development project, and I am still proud of what I was able to accomplish while knowing so little.  

However, it is a project where the cost to maintain is larger than the benefit that effort would provide to anyone. 
It wouldn't increase my development skills more than the projects I'm currently working on, and it wouldn't
be a big benefit to the wider public, as many better alternatives that do the same job exist. 

I leave this project here out of my own sentimentality for the project
